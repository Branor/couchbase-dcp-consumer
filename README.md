# Couchbase DCP Consumer Integration Demo

This is an example Couchbase DCP consumer and is meant to serve as the basis for integrating Couchbase with any streaming systems, such as Storm, or implementing trigger-based scenarios, such as Pub/Sub.
Based on the excellent [couchbase-kafka](https://github.com/avsej/kafka-couchbase-demo) integration demo by Sergey Avseyev.
